 <h1>What Do Different Languages Do?</h1>

  <p>If all computer languages do the same thing (make the computer do what you want), then why does it matter which one you choose? For the same reason that you wouldn’t take a bicycle to pick up a fridge or get a physical from an oncological neurosurgeon. Some tools are better for certain jobs.</p>

  <p>It’s possible for a C programmer and a Java programmer to read each other’s code, but it’s harder to make C code and Java code work together. C and Java represent the world in different ways, structure data in different ways, and address the components of the computer in different ways. There are true benefits to everyone on a team using the same language. They’re all thinking the same way about how to instruct the computer to process data.</p>

  <p>It’s not necessary for every team across a big organization to use the same language. In fact, it’s often counterproductive. Large organizations have lots of needs and use many languages and services to meet them. For example, Etsy is built atop PHP—but its product-search service uses Java libraries, because the solutions for search available in Java are great.</p>

  <p>Some programming languages, such as C, will do their best to do exactly as you ask, even if that means crashing your computer. Others, like OCaml and Haskell, are very constrained and ask a programmer to hew to a narrow form, trying to steer you away from anything stupid.11</p>
